    - This will switch the App to the "Auto Message Tools" view.
    - From the options on the Sidebar, click "Auto Message New Followers" (see screenshot below).
    - A message box will appear where you can now begin to compose your message.
    - To include personalised content (such as each follower's display name or username) into your message, hover on the "Insert Variables" button, and click the desired variable you want to include. When the messages are being sent to each new follower, IGdm Pro will replace the variables with the user's actual username or display name.
    - Once you are done composing your message, click on the "Save Automatic Message" button save it.
    - Note that your auto-message has not been enabled yet, it has only been saved at this point.

    - To enable the auto-message which you composed in the previous steps, simply click the toggle switch as seen in the screenshot below. Your auto-message will be enabled for as long as the toggle switch is enabled. If you'd like to temporarily disable the auto-message, you can simply turn off the toggle switch and it will be disabled for that period.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;

    Now that your auto-message is enabled, once your Instagram account gets new followers, they will receive the message within 30 minutes of following you.

    **NOTE:** The auto-message feature will not work if your IGdm Pro app is not running. However, once you re-start the app, it will begin to work again.
